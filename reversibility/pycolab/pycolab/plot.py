class Plot(dict):
  """The pycolab "plot" object---a blackboard for communication.

  By design, a game's `Engine`, its `Backdrop`, and its `Sprite`s and `Drape`s
  are not really meant to talk to each other directly; instead, they leave
  messages for each other in the game's `Plot` object. With the exception of
  messages to the `Engine`, these messages are free-form and persistent; in
  fact, let's drop the pretence---a `Plot` is really just a `dict` with some
  extra methods and properties, and to talk to each other, these entities should
  just modify the dict in the usual ways, adding, removing, and modyfing
  whatever entries they like. (Responsibly, of course.)

  (Note: in a limited way, the `Backdrop` and `Sprite`s and `Drape`s are allowed
  to inspect each other, but these inspections should be limited to small,
  read-only interactions via public methods and attributes. This capability is
  only really there to simplify things like getting the row/col coordinates of
  other sprites. Try not to abuse it!)

  (Note 2: Game developers who are designing ways for `Sprite`s, `Drape`s and
  the `Backdrop` to communicate with each other via the `Plot` object might find
  the `setdefault` method on `dict` to be especially useful. Or not.)

  The messages to the Engine have more structure. A `Backdrop`, a `Sprite`, or
  a `Drape` can direct the engine to do any of the following:

  * Change the z-ordering of the `Sprite`s and `Drape`s.
  * Add some quantity to the reward being returned to the player (or player)
    in response to their action.
  * Terminate the game.

  A dedicated method exists within the `Plot` object for all of these actions.

  Lastly, the `Plot` object contains a number of public attributes that the
  `Engine` can use to communicate various statistics about the game to the
  various other game entities.

    External code is not meant to manipulate `_EngineDirectives` objects
    directly, but `Engine` and `Plot` objects do. Properties of this class
    include:

    * `z_updates`: an indexable of 2-tuples `(c1, c2)`, whose semantics are
      "move the `Sprite` or `Drape` that paints with character `c1` in front of
      the `Sprite` or `Drape` that paints with character `c2`." If `c2` is
      None, the `Sprite` or `Drape` is moved all the way to the back of the
      z-order (i.e. behind everything except the `Backdrop`).
    * `summed_reward`: None, if there is no reward to be reported to the player
      (or players) during a game iteration. Otherwise, this can be any value
      appropriate to the game. If there's ever any chance that more than one
      entity (`Sprite`, `Drape`, or `Backdrop`) would supply a reward during a
      game iteration, the value should probably be of a type that supports the
      `+` operator in a relevant way.
    * `game_over`: a boolean value which... is True until the game is over.
    * `discount`: reinforcement learning discount factor to report to the
      player during a game iteration; typically a fixed value until the end of
      the game is reached, then 0.
